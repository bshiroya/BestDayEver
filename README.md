The goal for "Best Day Ever" was a mobile application that would provide suggestions on things to do without necessarily understanding initially what you like or do not like (but which would learn over time)

To do this we needed
1) To know your location to figure out what places are nearby (using Here.com Places API)
2) What's the current weather today
 - Saturday might be a good day to go to the beach - but not if it's 15 F outside :-)
3) What's your schedule look like today - do you have 1 hour to kill (lunch date?) or 3 hours (visit a museum?) or a whole day (go to the beach?)
